### **Software Engineer & DevOps Specialist**
Over the decade I have worked in software development, Iâ€™ve performed roles from design through implementation, guided by a passion for delivering higher quality software. I have focused on the software delivery process, with experience ranging from traditional installers to cloud-native continuous delivery.

My background in the humanities gives me a unique perspective in technology, and my experience in education has given me the skills to train and lead others effectively. Drawing upon these skills have allowed me to drive technology adoption and evangelize the DevOps approach to organizations both large and small.
